## About Operating System
```{note}
If you are already familiar with operating systems, you can skip this section. 
```
### Basic
An **operating system** (OS) is the fundamental software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer. It serves as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user.
It handles basic tasks such as:

1. **Managing Resources**: The OS manages the computerâ€™s memory, processor, disk space, and other resources, ensuring each program gets what it needs to run smoothly.

2. **User Interface**: The OS provides a user interface (UI), which can be graphical (GUI) like Windows and macOS, or command-line based like Linux. This allows users to interact with the computer through windows, icons, and menus or by typing commands.

3. **Running Applications**: The OS allows you to run multiple applications at the same time. It allocates the necessary resources and ensures that each application operates efficiently without interfering with others.

4. **File Management**: The OS organizes files on storage devices, allowing you to create, delete, move, and organize your data in a structured way.

5. **Security and Access Control**: The OS helps protect your computer by managing user permissions and access rights, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain files and applications.

Common examples of operating systems include ***Microsoft Windows***, ***macOS***, ***Linux***, ***Android***, ***iOS***. 

### Examples
There are brief descriptions of some popular operating systems below:
#### Microsoft Windows
Microsoft Windows is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI), making it user-friendly and accessible for beginners. Windows is known for its compatibility with a wide range of software and hardware, making it a popular choice for personal computers, business environments, and gaming.
#### macOS
Developed by Apple Inc., macOS is the operating system used on Macintosh computers. Known for its sleek design, strong security features, and seamless integration with other Apple products like the iPhone and iPad, macOS is favored by creative professionals and users who value a polished, cohesive user experience.
```{tip}
Different chips are used in Macintosh computers. (**Intel** and **Apple Silicon**)

Please check the chip type and select corresponding version when installing any software.
```
#### Linux
Linux is a family of open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is highly customizable and is known for its stability and security. There are many distributions (or "distros") of Linux, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, each with its unique features and user interfaces. Linux is popular among developers, system administrators, and users who prefer open-source software.
#### Android
Android is an operating system designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Developed by Google, Android is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel. It is known for its flexibility, wide range of applications available through the Google Play Store, and deep integration with Google's services.
#### iOS
iOS is the operating system for Apple's mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad. Known for its intuitive user interface and strong security, iOS offers a seamless experience across all Apple devices. It is highly optimized for performance and has a vast ecosystem of apps available through the Apple App Store.

## Some Bash Commands
```{note}
If you are already familiar with bash command in UNIX system, you can skip this section. 
```
### Shell & Terminal
**Shell** is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system. It interprets commands entered by the user and executes them. 
**Terminal** is the window where the shell runs, displaying the command prompt and allowing users to type commands.

In UNIX-base systems, popular shells include **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell), **Zsh** (Z Shell), and **Fish**.

In Windows, **Command Prompt** and **PowerShell** are commonly used shells.

## Version Control System
```{note}
If you are already familiar with version control systems, you can skip this section. 
```
A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps software developers manage changes to their source code over time. It tracks every modification made to the codebase, allowing developers to collaborate more effectively and ensuring that the history of changes is preserved. Here are some key points about VCS: **Tracking Changes, Collaboration**, **Backup and Restore**, **Branching and Merging**. Popular VCS includes the following tools: **Git**, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.

### Git & GitHub

**Git** is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git allows developers to keep track of changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of their projects. 

**GitHub** is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a collaborative environment for developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together. GitHub was founded in 2008 and has since become one of the largest code-hosting platforms in the world.
