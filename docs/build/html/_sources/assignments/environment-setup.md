```{important}
Please ensure you have installed Anaconda or Miniconda before starting this assignment. You will need to create a new Conda environment with the required packages.

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to set up your Python environment and ensure you have all the necessary packages installed. You will be using Conda to create a new environment and install the required packages. This setup will be used for subsequent assignments.

## Instructions

1. **Create a New Conda Environment**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use a Conda command to create a new Conda environment named `asg0` with Python 3.11 and the required packages (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`).
2. **Activate the New Environment**
   - After the environment is created, activate it using the appropriate Conda command.
3. **Verify the Environment**
   - List all Conda environments to verify that the new environment `asg0` was created successfully.
4. **Take a Screenshot**
   - Take a screenshot of your terminal showing the list of Conda environments. Ensure that `asg0` is listed.
